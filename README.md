# XP Core Values Implemented
1. Simplicity
- We analyzed all features that were to be implemented for the application and decided to choose the simplest yet powerful tools and technologies to implement.
- Keeping the application simple was a priority as it will also be easy to use by the users.
2. Courage
- Everyone of us was courageous enough to speak out loud whenever they faced some issues or felt something is going on wrong in the team.
3. Respect
- Respecting team mates opinion is one of the most important thing while we are working on a group project
- We respected everyone’s decision and tried to implement everyone’s ideas. If some ideas were not appropriate we had courage to explain it politely to them with valid reasons.
